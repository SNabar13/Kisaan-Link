This comprehensive solution empowers farmers to directly sell their produce to buyers, eliminating the need for intermediaries. The system ensures cost-effectiveness and facilitates the delivery of the freshest fruits and vegetables to buyers. Transportation efficiency is optimized through the innovative approach of truck pooling, dynamically allocating farmers' produce to trucks based on existing loads and destination routes. Transparency is enhanced by providing real-time tracking of orders in trucks, including live updates on their number plates and locations. Incentives are offered to frequent buyers, while farmers selling their produce daily benefit from reduced transport commission costs. The solution is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, leveraging its robust capabilities for seamless integration and efficient functionality.
